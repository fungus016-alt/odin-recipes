I learned how to set up a website, learned how toset up hyperlinks, how to attach links to texts. I learned about HTML, the distinction between absolute, relative and root-relative links.
I learned that I need to include the universal language of the system "meta charset = UTF-8" so every symbol will be displayed correctly on the webpage. I learned that it's a nice feature to add alt texts to an image so the screen readers can read to people who have any disability that makes it harder to read. I learned how to change the size of the image, I learned the headers, unordered and ordered lists. I learned how to make a <Strong>bold</strong> text or <em>Itallic</em> text as well. I learned that when I put links that are absolute, basically links that go to another webpage, I have to put the rel as "noopener nooreferrer" to be safe against phishing attacks and also for the webpage to not run into any Javascript problems with the main webpage. also learned that the target need to be "_blank". I learned the git basics, I'm practicing and I'm hoping to become better! I learned some terminal commands, back in the day I used to use kali linux as well so linux isn't all new to me, but coding is, it's new to me, and I like it a lot!
